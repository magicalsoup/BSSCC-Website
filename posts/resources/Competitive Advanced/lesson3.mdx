### Building the data structure

Let's build the data structure, first we understand we let our prefix sum array (psa) be defined as:

- psa[0] = 1.
- psa[i] = psa[i-1] for any index i in [1, n], where n is the length of the list.


Then we can build our data structure as follows:
```cpp
for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
    psa[i] += psa[i-1]
}
```

### Querying range queries:

Given an interval [l, r], our sum is then calculated as follows:

```
sum = psa[r] - psa[l-1]
```

We can see that prefix sum arrays are very powerful, and have many applications in competitive programming problems.
You can practice this data structure in the problems provided below:
